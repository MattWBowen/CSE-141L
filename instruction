//designated 5 bit for op code, which means we can have up to 25 instructions
//we have 16 register r0~r15, and by default r0 is the accumulator

1. take
description:    the content of the operand register is move into the accumulator register
operation:      $accumulator = $operand_register
syntax:         take $operand_register  

2. put
description:    the content of the accumulator register is move into the operand register
