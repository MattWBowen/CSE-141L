General Specification:
we have 16 register r0~r15, and by default r0 is the accumulator, and r1 is the branch register
General purpose registers are indicated with a dollar sign ($)
branch register, r1, holds addresses in memory
Immediate is indicated with a pound sign (#)


we have two type of instruction: 
R-type and I-type(special instruction) 
which is determined by the most significant bit(MSB) of 9 bits instruction 
we defined this MSB bit as the"type bit"

Normal-type: when the type bit is 0
    for the rest 8 bits, 4 bits for op code(16 opcodes in R-type), and 4 bits for operand (up to 16 registers in R-type)

Special-tpye: when the type bit is 1
    the remaining 8 bit are all used for immediate(up to 255), and the operation is stored the immediate into accumulator
    thus only one operation exist in I-type, we can treat it as an special instruction
    

Instruction format 
NOTE: 
1. for the encode part, 'i' represent immediate type, 'r' represent register type, 'x' represent don't care or undefined
2. op code are label with x in nomal type: _  x x x x  _ _ _ _
