//designated 5 bit for op code, which means we can have up to 25 instructions
//we have 16 register r0~r15, and by default r0 is the accumulator
//General purpose registers are indicated with a dollar sign ($)
//Immediate is indicated with a pound sign (#)
//All register, immediate and datapath is 8 bit wide

1. take
description:    the content of the operand register is move(take) into the accumulator register
operation:      $accumulator = $reg
syntax:         take $reg

2. put
description:    the content of the accumulator register is move(put) into the operand register
operation:      $reg = $accumulator
syntax:         put $reg

3. takei    --  take immediate
description:    an immediate is move(take) into the accumulator register
operation:      $accumulator = imm
syntax:         takei imm

4. load
description:    a byte is loaded into the accumulator from the address specified by operand register
operation:      $accumulator = MEM[$reg]
syntax:         load $reg

5. store 
description:    the content of accumulator is stored at the addres specified by operand register
operation:      MEM[$reg] = $accumulator
syntax:         store $reg
